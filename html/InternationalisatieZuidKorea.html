<h1>Study Experience in South Korea</h1>

<h2>Why South Korea?</h2>
<p>When I was looking for a destination for my Erasmus exchange, South Korea immediately stood out to me. I had been interested in Korean culture for a long time, and South Korea is also known for its technological advancements. The idea of going there appealed to me greatly.</p>

<p>The thought of immersing myself in a completely different culture and stepping out of my comfort zone felt like a fantastic challenge. This semester in Korea has helped me grow as a person and has taught me many valuable lessons. Moreover, during my stay in Korea, I learned to eat many new dishes, which further enriched my experience.</p>

<h2>Fascinating Courses</h2>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>
<p>In South Korea, I took several fascinating courses that challenged me and provided me with a lot of new knowledge. The first course covered highly theoretical concepts about algorithms and how to calculate their efficiency. Here, I learned the profound logic behind various algorithms and how to evaluate their performance. I was one of the few international students in the class, surrounded mainly by Korean classmates. While this was a unique learning experience, I sometimes faced challenges because some explanations were given in Korean. This made it difficult to stay fully focused. However, these linguistic challenges were not limited to just one course but were a recurring theme in almost all my classes.</p>

<h3>Embedded Software</h3>
<p>The second course focused on embedded software and its practical implementation. This was a hands-on experience where we learned how to integrate software into hardware, which was very valuable for my understanding of technological systems.</p>

<h3>Deep Learning</h3>
<p>Another fascinating course was deep learning, where we delved deeply into artificial intelligence. For our final project, we had to develop an AI that could identify objects in photos. This was a challenging but extremely educational process.</p>

<h3>Numerical Analysis</h3>
<p>The fourth course, numerical analysis, revolved around calculating various complex mathematical problems. This course provided an in-depth understanding of the mathematical principles underlying various calculations.</p>

<h3>Korean Language Course</h3>
<p>Finally, I also took a Korean language course, which was a great experience for better understanding the language of the country I was staying in.</p>

<h2>Level and Challenge</h2>

<p>Although the level of the courses at the university in South Korea was significantly higher than that of my home university, I am grateful that I passed all the courses. It was a challenging but extremely valuable experience in which I learned a lot.</p>
